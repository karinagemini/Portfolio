We have a long roadmap ahead of us and rarely run out of interesting problems to tackle. To make this a bit more specific you might be looking after some core payments tech like our Core Banking infrastructure for managing our ledger, accounts and cards, nurturing successful integrations with our multiple banking partners to support our global expansion in our new greenfield markets as well as working on more exotic features like our SEPA payments, Open Access/Open Banking, our in-house BNPL for SMEs, Accounting automation and much much more.\"\\t\"Defining, owning and maintaining the services your team owns from our service catalogue that fall in one of our domains (you design it, you build it, you run it, you scale it globally)Working with the product team to select technology partnersWork with backend engineers across multiple agile teams carefully dividing your time between design/refinement, implementation and mentoring other team membersRegularly aligning your team’s vision and roadmap with the target architecture within your domain and to ensure the success of complex multi domain initiativesWorking closely with product owners, mobile & web engineers, data scientist and other business members to translate requirements into well-engineered solutionsMaking key contributions to our Community of Practice. You will apply your extensive experience on our problem domain and existing guidelines to become a true beacon of best practices among your fellow engineers\"\\t\"Have some experience building server-side applications and detailed knowledge of the relevant programming languages for your stack. You don’t need to know Java, but bear in mind that we have 200+ microservice written in Java, so you need to be willing to learn it when you have to change something there! We are not looking for X+ years of experience, but for our more senior roles we tend to work best with people that have tried a couple of things in the industryHave a sound knowledge of a backend framework (e.g. Spring/Spring Boot) that you’ve used to write microservices that expose and consume RESTful APIs (in the world of Open Banking often times they are gonna be public!)Have experience engineering scalable and reliable solutions in a cloud-native environment (the most important thing for us is understanding the fundamentals of CI/CD, practical Agile so to speak)Demonstrate a mindset of delivering secure, well-tested and well-documented software that integrates with various third party providers and partners (we do that a lot in the fintech industry\"'"

We have a long roadmap ahead of us and rarely run out of interesting problems to tackle. To make this a bit more specific you might be looking after some core payments tech like our Core Banking infrastructure for managing our ledger, accounts and cards, nurturing successful integrations with our multiple banking partners to support our global expansion in our new greenfield markets as well as working on more exotic features like our SEPA payments, Open Access/Open Banking, our in-house BNPL for SMEs, Accounting automation and much much more.\"\\t\"Defining, owning and maintaining the services your team owns from our service catalogue that fall in one of our domains (you design it, you build it, you run it, you scale it globally)Working with the product team to select technology partnersWork with backend engineers across multiple agile teams carefully dividing your time between design/refinement, implementation and mentoring other team membersRegularly aligning your team’s vision and roadmap with the target architecture within your domain and to ensure the success of complex multi domain initiativesWorking closely with product owners, mobile & web engineers, data scientist and other business members to translate requirements into well-engineered solutionsMaking key contributions to our Community of Practice. You will apply your extensive experience on our problem domain and existing guidelines to become a true beacon of best practices among your fellow engineers\"\\t\"Have some experience building server-side applications and detailed knowledge of the relevant programming languages for your stack. You don’t need to know Java, but bear in mind that we have 200+ microservice written in Java, so you need to be willing to learn it when you have to change something there! We are not looking for X+ years of experience, but for our more senior roles we tend to work best with people that have tried a couple of things in the industryHave a sound knowledge of a backend framework (e.g. Spring/Spring Boot) that you’ve used to write microservices that expose and consume RESTful APIs (in the world of Open Banking often times they are gonna be public!)Have experience engineering scalable and reliable solutions in a cloud-native environment (the most important thing for us is understanding the fundamentals of CI/CD, practical Agile so to speak)Demonstrate a mindset of delivering secure, well-tested and well-documented software that integrates with various third party providers and partners (we do that a lot in the fintech industry\"'"
